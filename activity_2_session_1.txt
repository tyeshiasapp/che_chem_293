What does the model achieve?
- Derives a linear correlation between Car MPG and Car Wt
How should metrics be interpreted?
- P-value: 
- R square: 
- Slope: relationship between Car MPG and Cat Wt for the model (in addition to )

What are appropriate use cases?
- Correlating two variables with the expectation that the relationship is linear.
How is it implemented? *
- Minimizing difference between model and actual values from each point

It is okay to recognize limits of your expertise

It is NOT okay to misuse/misinterpret/misreport!

What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?
- Only 3 sample points, may benefit from more data

How to interpret this specific result and advising action/next steps?
- Car weight is heavily correlated with MPG, minimizing car weight can improve MPG drastically.
