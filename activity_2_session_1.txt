What does the model achieve?
- Derives a linear correlation between Sample Concentration and Response Time.
How should metrics be interpreted?
- P-value: 0.002856
- R square: 0.9650
- Slope: relationship between Sample Concentration and Response Time for the model

What are appropriate use cases?
- Correlating two variables with the expectation that the relationship is linear.
How is it implemented? *
- Minimizing difference between model and actual values from each point

What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?
- Only 4 sample points, may benefit from more data

How to interpret this specific result and advising action/next steps?
- Sample Concentration is moderately correlated to Response Time, indicative of R squared value below 0.99.
